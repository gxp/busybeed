.Sh NAME
.Nm busybeed.conf
.Nd busybeed daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for the busybee daemon,
.Xr busybeed 8 .
.Sh SECTIONS
.Nm
is divided into two main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Global Configuration
Global settings for
.Xr busybeed 8 .
Do note that global settings should never be placed after the devices section
has been defined.
.It Sy Devices
Devices are the configuration areas for each device a client can communicate
with.
.El
.Pp
The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash
.Pq Sq \e .
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
Care should be taken when commenting out multi-line text:
the comment is effective until the end of the entire block.
.Pp
Argument names not beginning with a letter, digit, or underscore
must be quoted.
.Ed
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
Here are the settings that can be set globally:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic default port Ar number
Set the default port for devices to communicate on. This is a required setting.
.It Ic bind interface Ar string
Specify a single interface to create sockets on. If this is not set,
.Xr busybeed 8
will attempt to open the default port on all network interfaces.
.It Ic max clients Ar number
Set the maximum number of clients allowed to connect to all
.Xr busybeed 8 sockets.
.It Ic max subscriptions Ar number
Set the maximum number of devices a client can subscribe to at a time.
.It Ic log verbose Ar number
Turn on verbose logging. (This option is currently disabled.)
.El
.Sh DEVICES
Devices represent a serial device or a TCP/IP host for
.Xr busybeed 8
to communicate with.
.Xr busybeed 8 
will setup sockets and bind to devices depending on the settings for each
device.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic baud Ar number
Set the baud rate for a serial device
.Ar location .
.It Ic bind interface Ar string
Specify a single interface to create a
.Ar location
or
.Ar ipaddr
device socket.
.It Ic data Ar number
Set the data bits for a serial device
.Ar location .
.It Ic connect on port Ar number
Set the TCP/IP port to connect to for an
.Ar ipaddr
device. This setting is required for
.Ar ipaddr
devices.
.It Ic device Ar string Brq ...
Declaration of a device for
.Xr busybeed 8
to setup and the name
.Xr busybeed 8
will use for client subscriptions.
.It Ic hardware Ar number
Set to 1 to turn on hardware control for a serial device
.Ar location .
OpenBSD doesn't use this. It's commented out in
.Xr busybeed 8 .
.It Ic ipaddr Ar string Brq ...
Create a
.Ar device
connection to an IPV4 hostname or IP address. IPV6 is not implemented yet.
.It Ic listen on port Ar number
Set a local socket port for a device
.Ar location
or
.Ar ipaddr
other than the global default port.
.It Ic location Ar string Brq ...
Create a
.Ar device
connection to serial interface. These are any valid /dev devices, for example
/dev/ttyU0.
.It Ic max clients Ar number
Set the maximum clients allowed to connect to a device
.Ar location
or
.Ar ipaddr ,
other than the global max client value.
.It Ic parity Ar string
Set the parity for a serial device
.Ar location .
Parity options are none, odd, even, or space.
.It Ic password Ar string
Set the subscription password for a device
.Ar location
or
.Ar ipaddr  .
.It Ic persistent Ar number
Set whether
.Xr busybeed 8
binds to an
.Ar ipaddr
device. If
.Ar persistent
is set to 0,
.Xr busybeed 8
will create a socket, send a client packet, and close that socket. Clients
cannot receive on a non-persistent
.Ar ipaddr
device.
.It Ic software Ar number
Set to 1 to turn on software control for a serial device
.Ar location .
.It Ic stop Ar number
Set the stop bit for a serial device
.Ar location .

.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Pa /etc/busybeed.conf
.Xr busybeed 8
configuration file.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
This configuration file would create a serial device and a TCP/IP host device.
The serial device would communicate on the default port, while the local network
ipaddr device would communicate on a separate port.
